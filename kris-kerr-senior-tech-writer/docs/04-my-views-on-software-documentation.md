I fell into software documentation by accident. In college I studied Computer Science because I was interested in discovering how computers worked. I was also an English major because I was always a big reader, and I wanted to read the classics. I wasn't interested in programming per se.

It made sense to become a programmer after college, but I soon found that I didn't care for writing code all day long, day in and day out. I found I liked the mix of writing code and writing about code (that is, explaining how the code worked). And so I became a technical writer.

You can have the best software on the planet but if your customers can't use your software, if it's too complicated or they just can't figure out how to use it, it's useless to them. Customers will move on to other software they can use.

After more than 20 years writing software documentation, I think software documentation should be:
- Clear
    - Nobody likes wading through documentation that's trying to be clever or obscure. 
- Useful
    - People read documentation to find an answer to a question. The quicker documentation can fulfill that need, the better.
- Concise
    - Nobody's got time to read tons of documentation. A reader appreciates documentation that gets straight to the point.

And that's it. Other technical writers will talk about the need to stringently follow a style guide, or that all of a company's documentation should be rigorously rewritten so that it all has the exact same voice and tone. I disagree. Nobody reads software documentation like a novel, and I have yet to find any customer who cares about voice and tone. In my experience, if software documenation is clear, useful, and concise, that's all that matters. If you're trying to do more than that, you're wasting time and resources.
