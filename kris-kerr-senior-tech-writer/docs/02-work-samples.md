| Type | Category | Document name/link | Notes |
|--------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Video file (.mp4) | How-to video | [How to use Ambit](work-samples/ambit-demo-prototype-1.mp4) | I created and pitched this as a prototype for a series of "how-to" videos to be posted on Redpoint's externally-facing static docs site. |
| | | | |
| Document (.pdf) | Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) | [Automated Machine Learning User Guide](work-samples/redpoint-aml-user-guide.pdf) | I wrote this user guide for Redpoint's Automated Machine Learning (AML) app. I worked closely with the corporate data scientist who was the brains behind the app, interviewing him and having him review my work. At one point I understood about 97% of everything I wrote about, the last 3% was postgraduate-level data science content that went straight to the "advanced topics" section. |
| | | | |
| | Overviews explaining how an app, technology, or process works | [Overview of Interactive Data Language automatic garbage collection](work-samples/exelis-idl-automatic-garbage-collection-feature-and-how-to-use-it.pdf) | This is a good example of a straighforward computer science topic I am comfortable writing because I earned a bachelor's degree in Computer Science.  |
| | | [Social Login Overview](work-samples/janrain-social-login-overview.pdf) | This is a short explanation of how social login in general works, how it is implemented by Janrain's software, and how to use Janrain's dashboard to control the software's social login features. It's a good example of how well-chosen diagrams and screenshots can substantially shorten a topic's word length and convey ideas more quickly. |
| | | [Data Builds Reference Manual](work-samples/sagent-data-builds-reference-manual.pdf) | This was the first assignment at this company, "explain the main data files we use and how we build our data files". It's a simple ask but not an easy task. Again, it was straightforward because I have a solid foundation in Computer Science. |
| | | | |
| | Procedure examples | [Save Images as KML Files (Arctic Research Flight Example)](work-samples/exelis-save-images-as-KML-files-arctic-research-flight-example.pdf) | This is an example of how to use a new Interactive Data Language (IDL) language feature in a real-world situation (via the command line). This is probably my favorite type of thing to write. I like walking the reader through from the general idea to the specific implementation, complete with a code sample and a sexy graphic. |
| | | [Save Images as KML Files (Contour Example)](work-samples/exelis-save-images-as-KML-files-contour-example.pdf) | Another example of how to use a new IDL feature in a real-world situation. Because writing these is so fun. |
| | | [Identity Provider Setup Example](work-samples/janrain-identity-provider-setup-example.pdf) | An example of a UI-based procedure. In this case, how to add and configure a new identity provider to Janrain's social login software. |
| | | | |
| | User Guides/Reference Manuals | [Master Data Management User Guide](work-samples/redpoint-master-data-management-user-guide.pdf) | The penultimate user guide I wrote intended to be viewed as a single .pdf file. An example of a typical user guide of UI-based software. |
| | | [Centrus Merge/Purge Library Reference Manual](work-samples/sagent-centrus-merge-purge-library-reference-manual.pdf) | An example of a C-based API user guide. This document was written completely by hand in Framemaker; now this kind of documentation is far easier to create via automated API documentation tools (and it would be a waste of time to do this the old-fashioned way today).  |
| | | [Geostan New Zealand Reference Manual](work-samples/sagent-geostan-new-zealand-reference-manual.pdf) | An example of a typical user guide of command line-based software. |
