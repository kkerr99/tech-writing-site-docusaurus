I have degrees in Computer Science and English, and my first few jobs after college were writing software. I know something about the mindset of both programmers and technical writers.

I know that technical writing is often not valued very highly in a software company, much like testing. These are not sexy jobs (in a programmer's mind), and to the business mind they are not core business activities, they suck up scarce money and resources and do not contribute to the bottom line.

But, there are some hard facts software companies must face:
- You cannot sell software without documentation. You absolutely must provide documentation with your software.
- Your company is judged by customers on the quality of your documentation.
    - If your documentation is slipshod and riddled with errors, customers will assume the software is the same.
    - However, if your documentation looks professional and is concise and useful, customers will automatically think more highly of your software.

*It is absolutely worth the time and resources to write high-quality documentation. The success of your product depends on it.*
