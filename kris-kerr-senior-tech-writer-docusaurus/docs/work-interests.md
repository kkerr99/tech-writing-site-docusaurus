## What I want to do for your company

I've written a lot of software documentation, just about every type there is. I'm satisfied that I can write compact, useful documentation in the real world.

At this stage I'm more interested in helping companies with their documentation tools and processes. I've seen the good, the bad, and the ugly (documentation-wise). I can help companies avoid common pitfalls and guide them to produce useful documentation via tools and processes that work in the real world.

If you're in the following situations, I can help:
- You're a small software company where developers have so far written all the documentation, and you're looking to hire your first technical writer.
- You've got a great software product, but you're not sure how to get started writing the documentation.
- Your software development process and your documentation process are not in sync. Or maybe your software development process doesn't include writing documentation at all.

## What I'm not interested in doing for your company

- I'm not interested in being a technical writing manager.
    - I've worked at companies that have technical writing teams, and companies that don't.
    - Personally, I think it's fine to embed one or more technical writers in a development team, and let the software team leader manage them.
    - As long as the technical writers at a company know the tools, style guide(s), and processes they should be using, they should do fine.
